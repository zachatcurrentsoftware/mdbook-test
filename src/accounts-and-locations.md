# Accounts & Locations

Note that in Current we track both Accounts and Locations separately. They are related, but distinct in a couple of important ways:

- Location: The service address, or physical property where service is being delivered. 
- Account. Tied to a specific individual who is accountable for the bill at a property

A Location will have a primary account linked to it - this is the account presently occupying the location. Similarly, an Account will have a Location that it is tied to. See the guides below for how to navigate between the two.
